# Mnist-dataset
Regression analysis of the mnist data-set, using  the Sequential model from keras library.
I've used matplotlib to visualize the outcomes of different metrics, i.e. I've compared accuracy with each epoch ran during the model compilation.
LIBRARIES USED: Keras; for the dataset and model selection.
                matplotlib for visualization.
